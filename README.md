# UT_Quiz_challenge
Repo for UT project #4
This is my Javascript quiz

## Descriptions
This was the quiz assignment. I opted to generate a template and add an array with all the pertinent data. I added the questions and responses for each as well as correct answer. The correct answer is compared to the letter choice for the chosen answer to see if they are correct. If they are correct then 10 points are added to their score. If they are not, then 10s are deducted. At the end you can add your name to the highscore and are presented with a table with highscores. Highscores cann also be cleared by the end.
